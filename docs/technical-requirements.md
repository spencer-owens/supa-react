   - Use multiplexing for shared resources (e.g., status updates)
   - Monitor and log connection metrics

### 2.3 Channel/DM Organization
1. **Channel Creation**: Users can create public/private channels in the channels table.
2. **Channel Membership**: RLS policies enforce read/write access based on membership.
3. **DM Creation**: Creates a dm_thread record with participants array.
4. **Deletion**: Channel creator can soft-delete via is_deleted flag.

### 2.4 File Sharing
1. **Upload**: Files up to 10MB stored in **Supabase Storage**.
2. File metadata stored in message attachments jsonb column.

   - Graceful degradation when limits are reached
   - Clear user feedback for connection issues
   - Automatic reconnection strategies
   - Fallback mechanisms for critical features

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Connection pooling configuration
   - Efficient query patterns
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Automatic cleanup triggers

### 2.13 Performance Optimization Requirements
1. **Message Rendering**
   - Implement virtualization for message lists
   - Use efficient pagination with cursor-based queries
   - Optimize message component re-renders
   - Implement lazy loading for media content

2. **State Management**
   - Use atomic state management for channel data
   - Separate concerns for messages, members, and typing indicators
   - Implement efficient state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Cache frequently accessed data with TTL

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Create specific indexes for common queries:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_messages_channel_created 
     ON messages(channel_id, created_at DESC);

     CREATE INDEX idx_messages_search 
     ON messages USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', content));
     ```
   - Implement materialized views for frequently accessed data:
     ```sql
     CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW channel_stats AS
     SELECT 
       channel_id,
       COUNT(*) as message_count,
       MAX(created_at) as last_message_at
     FROM messages
     GROUP BY channel_id;
     ```
   - Set up automatic view refreshes on data changes

4. **Asset Management**
   - Implement lazy loading for images and attachments
   - Use optimized image sizes based on viewport
   - Provide fallback for failed asset loads
   - Configure proper caching headers

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track connection and message latency
   - Monitor subscription count and channel usage
   - Implement automatic performance alerts
   - Log and analyze performance metrics

6. **Smart Caching**
   - Cache frequently accessed user data
   - Implement TTL-based cache invalidation
   - Cache channel member lists
   - Store recent message history

7. **Resource Management**
   - Implement priority levels for subscriptions
   - Track subscription access times
   - Automatic cleanup of inactive resources
   - Smart connection pooling

## 3. Authorization Requirements (RLS Policies)

1. **User Data Security**
   - Users can read/write their own data
   - Public fields (display_name, photo_url) readable by all
   - Presence data managed by Supabase Presence

2. **Channel Security**
   - Public channels readable by all, writable by members
   - Private channels completely hidden from non-members
   - Only creator can delete channel

3. **Channel Membership**
   - Public channels: Users can create own membership
   - Private channels: Existing members can add new members
   - Membership required for posting in all channels

4. **Message Security**
   - Channel messages require channel membership
   - DM messages require participant status
   - Edit/delete limited to sender or system
   - AI messages controlled by user preferences

5. **Storage Security**
   - Upload requires message posting permission
   - Download requires channel/DM access
   - RLS policies check membership status

6. **AI Features**
   - Edge Functions respect user AI preferences
   - Vector searches filtered by access permissions
   - AI responses follow channel/DM access rules

## 4. Real-Time Requirements

1. **Channels & Membership**
   - Subscribe to filtered channel list based on RLS
   - Real-time membership updates through NOTIFY/LISTEN
   - Presence updates for online members

2. **Messages**
   - Real-time subscriptions for current channel/DM
   - Cursor-based pagination for history
   - Thread messages as separate subscription

3. **Typing Indicators**
   - Managed through Supabase Presence
   - Ephemeral state with automatic cleanup
   - Channel/DM specific presence tracking

4. **User Presence**
   - Supabase Presence for online status
   - Client-side idle detection
   - Status changes broadcast in real-time

5. **Reactions**
   - Instant updates through database triggers
   - Count aggregation in real-time
   - Broadcast through NOTIFY/LISTEN

6. **Search**
   - On-demand full-text search queries
   - Results respect current RLS policies
   - Real-time updates after result selection

7. **AI Interactions**
   - Edge Function processing status updates
   - Real-time message delivery
   - Context retrieval through pgvector

## Conclusion

These technical requirements detail how to structure your **Supabase** implementation, including PostgreSQL tables, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions, and Edge Functions. The system leverages Supabase's built-in features: Auth for authentication, Storage for files, real-time NOTIFY/LISTEN for updates, Presence for user status, and pgvector for AI features. This architecture ensures secure, scalable, and real-time functionality while maintaining data integrity and access control through PostgreSQL's native capabilities.
